       "'Introduction to LangGraph: A Beginner\\'s Guide - Medium\\nhttps://medium.com/@cplog/introduction-to-langgraph-a-beginners-guide-14f9be027141\\nStateful Graph: LangGraph revolves around the concept of a stateful graph, where each node in the graph represents a step in your computation, and the graph maintains a state that is passed around and updated as the computation progresses.\\n   Nodes: Nodes are the building blocks of your LangGraph. Each node represents a function or a computation step. You define nodes to perform specific tasks, such as processing input, making decisions, or interacting with external APIs.\\n\\nstate graph node - GitHub Pages\\nhttps://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/\\nclass State(MessagesState):\\n    documents: list[str]\\n```\\n\\nNodes¶\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn LangGraph, nodes are typically python functions (sync or async) where the first positional argument is the state, and (optionally), the second positional argument is a \"config\", containing optional configurable parameters (such as a `thread_id`).\\n\\nSimilar to `NetworkX`, you add these nodes to a graph using the add_node method: [...] In short: _nodes do the work, edges tell what to do next_.\\n\\nLangGraph\\'s underlying graph algorithm uses message passing to define a general program. When a Node completes its operation, it sends messages along one or more edges to other node(s). These recipient nodes then execute their functions, pass the resulting messages to the next set of nodes, and the process continues. Inspired by Google\\'s Pregel system, the program proceeds in discrete \"super-steps.\" [...] 3.   `Edges`: Python functions that determine which `Node` to execute next based on the current `State`. They can be conditional branches or fixed transitions.\\n\\nBy composing `Nodes` and `Edges`, you can create complex, looping workflows that evolve the `State` over time. The real power, though, comes from how LangGraph manages that `State`. To emphasize: `Nodes` and `Edges` are nothing more than Python functions - they can contain an LLM or just good ol\\' Python code.'"

      "Okay, let me process the information from the tool response. The user asked if they can cancel their ticket 10 hours before the flight. The tool response mentions a 24-hour cancellation policy without penalty, but the user is asking about 10 hours. The key point here is that the policy allows cancellation within 24 hours of booking, not necessarily 10 hours before the flight. Wait, the response says \"within 24 hours of booking,\" which might be different from 10 hours before departure. The user might be confused between the time since booking versus time before the flight. I need to clarify that the 24-hour window is from when the ticket was purchased, not the departure time. So if they booked the ticket 10 hours before the flight, they might still be within the 24-hour window. But if the 10 hours is before the flight, but the booking was done more than 24 hours ago, then it might not apply. The answer should explain the 24-hour rule from booking and ask for more details if needed. Also, mention the steps to cancel and the refund policy. Make sure to keep it clear and helpful.\n",

       "  AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, let me process the information from the tool response. The user asked if they can cancel their ticket 10 hours before the flight. The tool response mentions a 24-hour cancellation policy without penalty, but the user is asking about 10 hours. The key point here is that the policy allows cancellation within 24 hours of booking, not necessarily 10 hours before the flight. Wait, the response says \"within 24 hours of booking,\" which might be different from 10 hours before departure. The user might be confused between the time since booking versus time before the flight. I need to clarify that the 24-hour window is from when the ticket was purchased, not the departure time. So if they booked the ticket 10 hours before the flight, they might still be within the 24-hour window. But if the 10 hours is before the flight, but the booking was done more than 24 hours ago, then it might not apply. The answer should explain the 24-hour rule from booking and ask for more details if needed. Also, mention the steps to cancel and the refund policy. Make sure to keep it clear and helpful.\\n</think>\\n\\nSwiss Airlines allows cancellations **within 24 hours of booking** without penalty, provided the ticket number starts with \"724\" (SWISS ticket/plate). This policy applies to all fare types, including non-refundable tickets, and entitles you to a full refund of the ticket price.\\n\\nHowever, your question specifies **10 hours before the flight**. If the 10-hour window falls within the 24-hour booking period, cancellation is permitted.
