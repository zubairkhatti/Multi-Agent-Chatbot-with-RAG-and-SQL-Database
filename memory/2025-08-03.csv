It simulates a **digital media store** (like a music or video store) and includes tables for managing customers, invoices, tracks, playlists, and more. It‚Äôs commonly used with **SQLite** but can be adapted to other SQL databases.

### Key Features:
- **Purpose**: Learn SQL queries, database relationships, and data manipulation.
- **Tables**: Includes 11 core tables (e.g., `Customer`, `Invoice`, `Track`, `Album`, `Artist`, `Playlist`, etc.).
- **Sample Data**: Contains realistic data for practice, such as customer details, sales transactions, and media metadata.

### Example Tables:
- **`Customer`**: Customer details (name, address, phone, etc.).
- **`Invoice`**: Sales transactions (customer, date, total amount).
- **`Track`**: Music or video tracks (title, album, genre, composer).
- **`Playlist`**: User-created playlists (e.g., ""Classical"", ""Rock"").
- **`Employee`**: Staff information (e.g., sales representatives).

### Use Cases:
- Practice SQL queries (e.g., ""Find all customers in Canada"" or ""List tracks by genre"").
- Explore relationships (e.g., ""Which customers have made purchases?"").
- Test data analysis (e.g., ""Total sales per country"").
